Project is divided into 2 parts, Part 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration and Part 2 - Climate App
# Part 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration
Python and SQLAlchemy have been used to do climate analysis and data exploration of your Hawaii database. Analyses have been completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. 
Query was done to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data, load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame, set the index to the date column, sort by date, plot results of DataFrame and printed summary statistics of data.
Second query was done to calculate the total number of stations, find the most active stations, retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data filtered by station with highest number of observations and plot result on histogram.
# Part 2 - Climate App
Flask to create routes to queries; Home page, precipitation, stations, tobs, start date query and end date query.
